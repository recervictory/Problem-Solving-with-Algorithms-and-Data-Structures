        "We will begin our study of data structures by considering four simple but very powerful concepts. `Stacks`, `queues`, `deques`, and `lists` are examples of data collections whose items are ordered depending on how they are added or removed. Once an item is added, it stays in that position relative to the other elements that came before and came after it. Collections such as these are often referred to as `linear data structures`.\n",

        "he remove method requires two logical steps. First, we need to traverse the list looking for the item we want to remove. Once we find the item (recall that we assume it is present), we must remove it. The first step is very similar to search. Starting with an external reference set to the head of the list, we traverse the links until we discover the item we are looking for. Since we assume that item is present, we know that the iteration will stop before current gets to None. This means that we can simply use the boolean found in the condition. When found becomes True, current will be a reference to the node containing the item to be removed. But how do we remove it? One possibility would be to replace the value of the item with some marker that suggests that the item is no longer present. The problem with this approach is the number of nodes will no longer match the number of items. It would be much better to remove the item by removing the entire node.\n",

Since current refers to the node ahead of the node where we would like to make the change, it is too late to make the necessary modification.\n",
        "\n",
        "The solution to this dilemma is to use two external references as we traverse down the linked list. current will behave just as it did before, marking the current location of the traverse. The new reference, which we will call previous, will always travel one node behind current. That way, when current stops at the node to be removed, previous will be referring to the proper place in the linked list for the modification.\n",
        "\n",
        "The code below shows the complete remove method. Lines 2–3 assign initial values to the two references. Note that current starts out at the list head as in the other traversal examples. previous, however, is assumed to always travel one node behind current. For this reason, previous starts out with a value of None since there is no node before the head (see Figure 3.28). The boolean variable found will again be used to control the iteration.\n",
