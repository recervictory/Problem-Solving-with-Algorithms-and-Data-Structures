        "We will begin our study of data structures by considering four simple but very powerful concepts. `Stacks`, `queues`, `deques`, and `lists` are examples of data collections whose items are ordered depending on how they are added or removed. Once an item is added, it stays in that position relative to the other elements that came before and came after it. Collections such as these are often referred to as `linear data structures`.\n",

Once we find the item (recall that we assume it is present), we must remove it. The first step is very similar to search. Starting with an external reference set to the head of the list, we traverse the links until we discover the item we are looking for. Since we assume that item is present, we know that the iteration will stop before current gets to None. This means that we can simply use the boolean found in the condition. When found becomes True, current will be a reference to the node containing the item to be removed. But how do we remove it? One possibility would be to replace the value of the item with some marker that suggests that the item is no longer present. The problem with this approach is the number of nodes will no longer match the number of items. It would be much better to remove the item by removing the entire node.\n",

That way, when current stops at the node to be removed, previous will be referring to the proper place in the linked list for the modification.\n",

Note that current starts out at the list head as in the other traversal examples. previous, however, is assumed to always travel one node behind current.
